In my daily work, it is frequent to monitor the performance of system running on a embedded device. The LEP project (http://www.linuxep.com/) is suitable for me so much. But, its framework is too complex. I just want to run a simple monitor client on my PC which monitor a set of devices at the same time.So I fork the project and do some customization.
